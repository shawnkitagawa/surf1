3. December has a higher standard deviation meaning that the data is spread out more than the data in June





Summary:

When looking at the screenshot that I provided, the data for prcp June and December illustrates that December tends to rain more than June by looking at the average of prcp. In conlcusion, June is a better time opening the surf shop becaues it has a higher tempereture then December, which attracts people who are looking to cool down in the beach. Another reason why June is reccomended is because December has higher precipitaion such as rain, drizzle, snow. Usually it is not good surfing while its rainning because it may cause diseases or infection. Due to that fact, it is estimated that there are not much people coming in seeking for a surf equipment.
